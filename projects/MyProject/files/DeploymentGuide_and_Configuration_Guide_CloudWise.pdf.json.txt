DEPLOYMENT AND CONFIGURATION GUIDE
1 DEPLOYING TO PILOT ENVIRONMENT (AZURE SUBSCRIPTION)
1.1 DEPLOYMENT STEPS
1. Create an Automation account with RunAs Service principal. Unfortunately ARM templates don't allow for creating AD service principals as yet, so this step is currently a manual. :unselected: Refer the blog https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/automation- secconfigure-azure-runas-account/ for the steps. :unselected: Creation of ServicePrincipal has a propensity to fail randomly. A basic verification whether it was successfully created is mandatory
2. Capture the AutomationAccount name and the resourcegroup. You will need them as parameters when you 'Deploy to Azure'
3. Deploy Arm template from this location https://github.com/AvyanConsultingCorp/azure-quickstart- templates/tree/master/azure-governancecloudwise
4. Note the URL of the Cloudwise App Service
1.2 POST DEPLOYMENT STEPS
Congratulations !
You have now successfully deployed the application. You will have to do a few additional steps to have the application configured
(by a Service Admin only)
· Click open the scheduleIngestion runbook and click start to run the runbook. This step will kickstart the data ingestion to the OMS workspace specified.
